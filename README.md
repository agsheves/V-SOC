# Background


The Virtual Security Operations Center is a project built for the [AI Tinkeres Hackathon in NYC in February 2025](https://nyc.aitinkerers.org/p/openai-realtime-voice-x-reasoning-hackathon-ai-tinkerers). The hackathon was to demo use cases for realtime voice and reasoning agents.

The VSOC concept is designed to close a gap that exists for travel risk management / personnel safety. Current options and limitations are:

|Option | Concept | Pros | Cons|
|-----|-------|-------|-----|
|1-1 support | Traveler contacts a dedicated point of contact (POC) | Dedicated, individualized support. Limited uptime so can be dual-hatted | Not scalable and hard to main 24/7, reactive |
|Many-1 | One person is responsible for a group travelers | Semi-individualized support, better resource allocation | Not scalable, limited personalization, hard to main 24/7, mostly reative |
|GSOC | A global security operations center (GSOC) provides a central POC for all staff who need assistance | Highly scalable, high capacity, can have multiple subject matter experts on hand / on call, has staffing / resources to allow personalization, can be proactive | Very expensive and resource intensive |

The VSOC aims to provide the resources and capacity of a GSOC in an efficient manner using AI voice and reasoning. This would combine the scaling and capacity benefits of a GSCO with the individualization and dedication of a 1-1 service allowing under-resourced teams to support travelers who need assistance.

## Golden Rules

* Response protocols must be designed by human SMEs
* There is always a human in the loop
* There must be a fallback to human support in cases where the AI cannot assist
